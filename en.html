<h3>Objectives</h3>

<p>
The main objective of the project is to develop a safe and effective DIVA subunit vaccine against epizootic hemorrhagic disease in cattle (EHDV serotype 8). This vaccine aims to protect cattle and other susceptible species, significantly reducing mortality and morbidity caused by this disease.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Validation of Protection Results in Cattle: Confirmation of efficacy, optimal dose and immune response in bovines.</li>

<li>Development of the Industrial Antigen Production Process: Optimization and industrial scale-up of the antigen using CrisBio® technology.</li>

<li>Development of Analytical and Diagnostic Tools: Development of quality control tools and differential diagnosis between vaccinated and infected animals.</li>

<li>Structural and Formulation Studies: Structural characterization of the antigen and optimization of stable and effective formulations.</li>

<li>Production of Regulatory Banks and Batches: Production of banks and regulatory batches under GMP conditions.</li>

<li>Execution of Clinical Trials and Generation of the Regulatory Dossier: Clinical trials in cattle and preparation of the regulatory dossier for EMA.</li>
</ol>
